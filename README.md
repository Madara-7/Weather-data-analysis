Introduction
This script focuses on cleaning and preparing weather data for analysis, specifically for locations Adelaide and Gold Coast. It covers steps such as handling missing values, outlier detection, feature engineering, and exploratory data analysis.

Data Overview

The initial exploration of the dataset includes loading the data, checking its shape and information, and identifying various types of features (numerical, discrete, continuous, categorical).

Data Cleaning

Handling Missing Values

Missing values in both locations' datasets are addressed for continuous, discrete, and categorical features. Techniques such as imputation with medians and modes are applied.

Outlier Handling

Outliers in continuous features are identified and addressed using the IQR (Interquartile Range) method. This ensures a cleaner and more accurate dataset for analysis.

Feature Engineering

The script includes feature engineering steps, such as creating dummy variables for binary categorical features and mapping categorical variables to numerical representations.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

EDA is performed to gain insights into the distribution of continuous features, identify patterns, and visualize the impact of rainfall on different features.

Correlation Analysis

The correlation matrix is visualized to understand the relationships between different variables and identify potential multicollinearity.
